However, statistically in every world cup there is a story about underdog going far and big names getting kicked out in group. I think it&#39;s time for Mexico to break their course, by being kicked out in group or going into quarterfinals. Also, I think that either Morocco, Iran, Tunisia or Saudi Arabia will get to second round. Even though your predictions are pretty much realistic, they are too much realistic. Some underdogs will definitely shock us with good games, and some big names will shock us with bad games. That is what I expect from World cup.

The European, Middle Eastern, and to a lesser extent East African countries, have very similar time zones to Qatar. But a lot of the European countries (Central &amp; Eastern) will be +/- 1 hour from Qatar. It is a known fact that time difference plays a big part. Now with a lot of South American players playing in Europe, it&#39;s less of a factor. But South, Central, and North American teams will suffer as will the African.

This means some games were played from afternoon (5PM Indonesian time) to night (2AM Indonesian time). Opening game is 11PM Indonesian time, while Final is 10PM Indonesian time.<br>4.Might be a good time to see the dark horse in tournament. Could it be Denmark, Canada, Wales, Senegal, or even Qatar, who wants to avoid South Africa from being the World Cup host with the worst result (crashed out in group stage). Also, we will see how France continued the Champions Curse and England bringing the football back to home.<br>5.If the Qatar World Cup is considered success, it will be a high hope of country to host the next major tournaments. Qatar will host the 2023 Asian Cup with 8 World Cup stadiums likely hosted all games. This will be interesting since the Asian Cup sees four ASEAN teams playing in the tournament plus weaker teams like Hongkong and Tajikistan. It might be a good time to see Qatar aims to defend the trophy at home.<br><br>The major downsides:<br>1.Qatar needs an improvement regarding crowd control. We don&#39;t want it to suffer the disaster like in Indonesia, when hundreds of people died after crowd control mismanagement.<br>2.The World Cup takes place in the middle of the domestic league, so it&#39;s not an ideal. Players have been injured and missed out the chance to fly to Qatar."}
